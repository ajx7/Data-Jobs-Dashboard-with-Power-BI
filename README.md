# Power BI Data Jobs Dashboard Projects

## Overview
The Data Jobs Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project built to analyze trends in the global data science job market (2024).
It helps job seekers, career switchers, and data professionals explore insights such as job demand, salaries, and locations in one place — transforming raw job posting data into actionable visuals.

This repository contains two dashboard versions, each created to explore different design styles and Power BI techniques while using the same dataset.
